A default VLAN is the VLAN where all switch ports belong after the initial boot up of a switch loading the default configuration. A native VLAN is assigned to an 802.1Q trunk port, and untagged traffic is placed on it. A management VLAN is any VLAN that is configured to access the management capabilities of a switch. An IP address and subnet mask are assigned to it, allowing the switch to be managed via HTTP, Telnet, SSH, or SNMP.",

The S in a routing table signifies that a route was installed using the ip route command. Two of the routing table entries shown are static routes to a specific destination (the 192.168.2.0 network). The entry that has the S denoting a static route and [1/0] was configured using the next-hop address. The other entry (S 192.168.2.0/24 is directly connected, Serial 0/0/0) is a static route configured using the exit interface. The entry with the 0.0.0.0 route is a default static route which is used to send packets to any destination network that is not specifically listed in the routing table.",

When DAI is enabled, the switch drops ARP packet if the sender MAC address and sender IP address do not match an entry in the DHCP snooping bindings database. However, it can be overcome through static mappings. Static mappings are useful when hosts configure static IP addresses, DHCP snooping cannot be run, or other switches in the network do not run dynamic ARP inspection. A static mapping associates an IP address to a MAC address on a VLAN.",
